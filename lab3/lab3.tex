\section{Random Numbers}
Here is the diary created when the program runs:
\listinginput[1]{1}{RandDiary.txt}

\section{Hidden Images}
% discussion
The lab manual stated that the images could be found in the first, second, or third row and first, second, or third column. This created a 3x3 matrix where each point could be the starting point of the hidden image. The starting point of the hidden image scattered in every ninth row and sixteenth column of the original image could be changed simply by changing the starting position of an array search. For example, trying to find the hidden image starting in row two and column three in the coded array would look like CodedArray(2:9:end,3:16:end). Four images were found aside from the original array. Their starting coordinates in the matrix were (1,1),(1,2),(2,3), and (3,1).

\section{Chapra 2.18-2.19}
In the two graphs, every data point that was below the function line in figure 1 remained below the function line in figure 2. In figure 2 the function line is exponential whereas in figure one it is strictly linear. Also, the distribution along the x axis in figure 1 is evenly spaced whereas this is not the case for figure 2.

\section{Chapra 2.22}
% discussion - use \cite[p.~51]{Chapra}
The equations being plotted are each of the dimensions of the conical helix  with respect to $t$.
The equations are \cite[p.~51]{Chapra}:
\begin{align*}
x &= t\mbox{ cos(6t)}\\
y &= t\mbox{ sin(6t)}\\
z &= t\\
\end{align*}

\section{Weather Data Analysis}
The specific information weather information calculated is:
\listinginput[1]{1}{WeatherDiary.txt}
The noontime irradiance seems to follow a the path of a negative parabola with quite a bit of variation. It is highest toward the middle of the year, in the summer, whereas it is lowest during the winter. The January hourly temperature varies with the hour of the day. It is coldest in the night but begins to warm up as the day goes on, then drops again when night hits. This causes the pattern we see in the graph with very little variance from the expected pattern. The temperature does increase with the days very slightly at each time as the weather begins to warm up toward the end of January.

% Be sure to include the community standard in codes!

% Add \pagebreaks if they make sense

% Put the files in the same order as the problems; generally,
