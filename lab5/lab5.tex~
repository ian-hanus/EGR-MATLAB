\section{Chapra Problem 3.5}
% Discussion
Interesting differences in the graphs include the change in relative error and the shape of graphs where the actual values are identical. For example, the sin of 0.7854 and the sin of 7.0686 should represent the same values, but the graphs do not look similar at all. The graph of 7.0686 actually begins with an overestimation as the relative error is positive, whereas the relative error of the approximation for 0.7854 stays negtive across all terms. The same can be said for the larger values of sin that are similar, as they are separated by intervals of 2 pi. 
\section{Chapra Problem 3.10}
% Values for where and what the greatest displacements are should
% be here. 
% The final plot is in the Appendix. 
% The full text of the function and script are in the Appendix
The maximum value of displacement of the beam was 1559.9 at a distance of approximately 7.00000 feet from the end of the beam. The minimum value of displacement of the beam was -5265.1 at approximately 7.00001 feet from the end of the beam.
\section{Chapra Problem 3.14}
% Commentary on which grand challenge(s)
This problem relates most closely to the ''engineer the tools for scientific discovery'' engineering Grand Challenge. This anonymous function allowed us to calculate velocity of a rocket. By calculating the velocity of the rocket, one could determine the path of the rocket and guide it through an exploration of space in pursuit of scientific discovery.
