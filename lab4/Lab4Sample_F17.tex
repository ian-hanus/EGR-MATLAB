%% IMPORTANT: Once working, run latex 3 times to get listoffigures to work

%% Be sure to check spelling!

%% Put **your** name and the proper due date in place

%% Copy the lstlisting and figure code as many times as you need
%% Be sure to put in your own file names if appropriate

%% Note that the \epsfig command is currently commented out - until the
