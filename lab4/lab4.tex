\section{Chapra Problem 2.10}
% Nothing to add here!
The code and the graph are in the appendices.

\section{Chapra Problem 2.22}
The equations for the butterfly curve\cite[p.~52]{Chapra} are:
\begin{align*}
x = \mbox{ sin}(t)(e^{\mathrm{cos}(t)}-2\mbox{cos}(4t)-\mbox{sin}^5(\frac{t}{12}))\\
y = \mbox{ cos}(t)(e^{\mathrm{cos}(t)}-2\mbox{cos}(4t)-\mbox{sin}^5(\frac{t}{12}))\\
\end{align*}
These equations generate a butterfly curve because of the sinusoidal nature of the sine and cosine graphs. The two long phrases in parentheses in the equation above match, so they simply determine the magnitude of the sin($t$) and cos($t$) graphs that distinguish x from y. The changing comparison of sin and cos at the different points make the butterfly appear.

\section{Palm Problem 3.12}
The equation for the length of the fence is:
\begin{align*}
\mbox{Length} =& \mathrm{Area}-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{\mathrm{Width}}{\sqrt{2}})^2\\
\end{align*}
