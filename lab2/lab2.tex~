\section{Introduction}
% Add your introduction here
The program created takes inputs of mass in kilograms and converts it into force in Newtons by multiplying by 9.81. It then takes inputs of displacement in inches and converts these to displacement in meters. The program then plots the points with the force as the independent variable and the corresponding displacements as the dependent variable. A best fit line for a first order polynomial is found and graphed along with the data points. Then 100 representational force values are created between the minimum and maximum forces and used to predict displacement. Next the slope and y-intercept of the best fit line are  measured which, according to the equation Displacement $=$ Compliance$*$Force $+$ Initial Displacement, means compliance is equal to the slope and initial displacement is equal to the y-intercept. Then, looking at the graphs for each data set, one can tell if the line fits the data well which determines if the beam is acting as aspring.

\section{Data Obtained}
The three data sets from the experiments are presented in Table

the coefficients given in Table \ref{Coefs} 
produce the best-fit of the data to a straight line.

\section{Conclusions}
% Add your conclusions here
In a spring, force is directly proportional to displacement. The results of the programs are the slope (compliance) and y-intercept (initial displacement) of the best fit line for the data given. As the best fit line is first order, if the line describes the data well then that data is also linear. Because the only data that is accurately represented by its best fit line is the data of Beam 1, the only beam that acts like a spring is Beam 1. The best fit line of Beams 2 and 3 do not accurately represent the data from Beams 2 and 3, so Beams 2 and 3 do not act like springs.
%The results obtained when running the programs are the slope and y-intercept of the best fit line for the data given. This best fit line is a first order polynomial. Therefore, if the data can be well described by the best fit line that data is linear. The only data set that is well described by its line of best fit is Beam 1. Because characteristically in springs the force is directly proportional to the displacement, and the best fit line is an accurate representation of the data points, Beam 1 acts as a spring . Beams 2 and 3 are not accurately represented by their lines of best fit so they cannot be considered springs.
